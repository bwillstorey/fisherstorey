								<p>In the current nonprofit and social enterprise ecosystems, there are a number of barriers limiting significant social impact in our communities. 
									Nonprofit organizations are attempting innovative approaches to programming but their organizational structure and fundraising strategies are often 
									laborious and ineffective. Collaborations and partnerships are encouraged but rarely come to fruition, or if they do, the responsibilities are not shared equally. 
									Donors demand transparency and socially responsible business practices of the institutions they invest in which is another challenge for today’s nonprofit organizations. 
									Similarly, social enterprise businesses are expected to exhibit the same kind of transparency and ethical practices while working in a for-profit context. 
									What is social impact? How can you apply it in your world? How can it be measured? What are the key performance indicators? How are these benchmarks defined? 
									How should this information be shared with stakeholders? Where do you even begin???
								</p>
								<p>Fisher Storey can offer guidance in each of these areas. With over 30 years collective experience, our company provides organizational assessment and customized 
									solutions for nonprofit organizations, social enterprise, and for profit businesses through one-on-one coaching and social impact planning. We offer affordable options for both large, well-established institutions and emerging social impact initiatives and businesses. Our areas of 
									expertise include fundraising and development, earned revenue strategies, administrative operations, project management, event planning, marketing 
									strategies, social enterprise feasibility studies, and impact measurement.
